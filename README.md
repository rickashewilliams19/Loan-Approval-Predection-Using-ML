# Loan-Approval-Predection-Using-ML

Project Summary:

This Python project aims to perform binary classification on a given dataset. The project follows these key steps:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and prepared. Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded for machine learning.

Train-Test Split: The data is divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Model Building and Evaluation: Three distinct classifiers (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine) are trained and assessed. The project calculates and reports accuracy, confusion matrices, and detailed classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for each model.

Model Selection: By comparing the performance of these classifiers, the project assists in selecting the most suitable algorithm for the binary classification task on the specific dataset.

This project serves as a valuable tool for data analysts and scientists seeking to automate and streamline the process of dataset preparation, model training, and performance evaluation, ultimately aiding in informed decision-making for binary classification tasks.
